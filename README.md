# Overview

Despite its simple nature, this program is the start of something grand. It marks the beginning of my journey to where I am today - wherever that may be! Everything starts from a seed. For me, that was learning how to display the simple phrase "Hello World" onto the screen in Python.

This software combines what I already know about Python with what I only knew when I started learning it.

This program should invoke some sort of emotion. Perhaps it is wonder, amazement, awe, or simply boredom. Whatever the case, feel free to move along.
